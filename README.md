Visual-Studio-Templates
=======================

Installing:

1) Zip up the folder of the template that you want to install

2) Place the zip into Visual Studio's Installed Templates folder
   Usually: Documents\Visual Studio XXXX\Templates\
   Project Templates folder for project templates
   Item Templates folder for item templates



Note:
Zipping the folders using 7z does not seem to always work.
